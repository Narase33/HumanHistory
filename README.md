# HumanHistory
The definitive guide for human history

Did you know the first city (Jericho) was built 9.000 BC? I didn't.

The goal of this repository is to collect as many milestones (or other events with big impact on humankind) as possible and process them into a  (graphical) timeline.

If you want to contribute please make a pull request with the date, the name of the event and a source so I can validate it or message me with the necessary information. Provide the date as precise as possible, but I'm also happy with events that can only be dated back to a specific year.

This timeline is seen as the timeline of human kind and follows the Holocene calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar) as it's seen to start with the "modern" human history.

Thank you
