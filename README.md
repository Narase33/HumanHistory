# HumanHistory
The definitive guide to human history

## Overview
Did you know the first city (Jericho) was built 9.000 BC? I didn't.

The goal of this repository is to collect as many milestones (or other events with big impact on humankind) as possible and process them into a  (graphical) timeline.

## Q&A

### Where does the timeline start?
This timeline is seen as the timeline of humankind and follows the Holocene calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar) as it's seen to start with the "modern" human history.

### Whats the date format?
YYYY.MM.DD - NAME_OF_EVENT
Because thats the best way to sort dates

### I'd like to contribute, but how?
If you want to contribute please make a pull request with given format and a source so I can validate it or message me with the necessary information. Provide the date as precise as possible, but I'm also happy with events that can only be dated back to a specific year.

I'm not an historian, I don't know much about history so I rely on source that prove the event.

### I'd like to contribute a date but I'm unsure if it fits
In general I'm more willing to set the entry then to deny it. If you're not sure if it's impartant enough just send it an I will evaluate.


### What about events with different dates
We have this case for example with the Bronze Age. Its set to different times in different locations of earth. Either give me the eariest date or all of them. We can't have too much information.

Thank you
